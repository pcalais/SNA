We present an algorithm that generates community embeddings using rw + PCAs.
We compare them with centrality measures and show that there are two classes
of neutral users.


A typical task in network analysis is detecting communities. In this paper, we focus
on the opposite task: ranking users by the degree to which they are not part of communities. 
We leverage the following fundamental observations: (1) users in a social network post a set of messages,
so their behavior is pulverized in many instances, what is a lot useful for statistical reasons. The typical
user-to-user network, you see the user as a single node; it is much better to see its behavior several times
through their messages, as a bernoulli sequence.

A tentative approach would be to run community detection and then sort by probabilities. Most community
detection algorithms do assign hard labels to communities.

The practical application of our approach is that we can quiclky rank who to follow in a new unknown domain.
